We will be meeting in front of the Courthouse in Uptown Athens for a UNITED Prayer Gathering. Our focus is very clear: united prayer for the peace and presence of God to fill our city and heal our land. We are praying for change, justice, healing, and peace. We are praying for an outpouring of the Spirit of God across this city and our nation. This is open to anyone who wants to join us to pray. We would love to see you there!
